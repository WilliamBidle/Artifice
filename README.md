A homemade machine learning neural network architecture modeled after TensorFlow

In order to use the functions in a different Python file, make sure to download the ***Quadrature_Simulation_Methods.py*** file to the same folder as the new code and use the command:

    from Quadrature_Simulation_Methods.py import *

The full list of functions, their usage, as well as some examples can be found within the above Python file.
    pip install git+https://github.com/WilliamBidle/Baby-TensorFlow
